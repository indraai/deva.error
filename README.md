# Error Deva

The Error Deva

The Error Deva is a specialized module in the Indra.ai ecosystem designed to handle, capture, and report errors across Deva Core and its connected agents. It provides a consistent and structured way to log, trace, and escalate issues while preserving full chain-of-custody with cryptographic validation. This ensures that every error event is not only recorded for debugging but also backed by verifiable hashes, making the records secure, auditable, and reliable.

By installing with npm install @indra.ai/deva.error --save, developers gain access to a ready-to-use error management system that integrates seamlessly into the Deva Core framework. The Error Deva transforms errors into actionable intelligence, routing them into logs, reports, and monitoring channels while maintaining compliance with the layered Vedic License Agreement (VLA). It’s more than just error handling—it’s a safeguard for lawful operation and trustworthy system oversight.

install: `npm i @indra.ai/errordeva --save`

usage: 
```js
import error from '@indra.ai/deva.error')';
-or-
const error = require('@indra.ai/deva.error');
```
